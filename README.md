# SVGR Workflow

A workflow using advanced configuration of SVGR to deliver complex behaviour for SVG files in React.

Includes:

 - [babel-plugin-svgr-replace-jsx-tags](packages/babel-plugin-svgr-replace-jsx-tags) - a custom Babel plugin for replacing SVG tags during SVGR processing (used for the example process below.)
 - [heist-component](packages/heist-example) - an example component built using the above.
 - [heist-example](packages/heist-component) - an example project to demonstrate the above.

This work was presented at [React Melbourne meetup](https://www.meetup.com/react-melbourne/events/296479424/) - the [video is available on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SV6JzMUu_vU&t=8830s).
